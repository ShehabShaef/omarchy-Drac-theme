### 🌌 About the Theme

**Omarchy Drac** is the **Blue Dragon** of the Omarchy realm — a deep, balanced theme built around harmony, focus, and elegant energy.

The fonts — **Roboto** and **Roboto Mono** — give the Drac theme a modern, balanced tone that matches its calm yet powerful aesthetic.

### 🧙‍♂️ Design Philosophy

The **Drac Theme** embodies the *Blue Dragon* — calm yet powerful.  
Every shade, shadow, and glow was chosen to represent:
- Serenity in work.  
- Depth in creation.  
- Precision in focus.  

It’s not just a theme — it’s a **presence** across your desktop.
